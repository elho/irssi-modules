The irssi-idea plugin was written by Heikki Hannikainen <hessu@hes.iki.fi>,
some modifications and updates by Pekka Aleksi Knuutila <pa@debian.org>. 

Sources can be found at http://www.inside.org/~zur/irssi-idea/ and

The plugin wrapper is under the GPL, see /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL on
Debian systems. The IDEA library is not!

The IDEA algorithm is patented in many countries, and the patent holder
disallows commercial use (in which case you need to obtain a license).

This is strong crypto, and might be illegal to use or import/export
in some fascist countries. Check your local regulations!
