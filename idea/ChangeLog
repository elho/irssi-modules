	- Rewrote plugin.c to work with 0.7.98.3

Fri Apr 27 18:07:34 EEST 2001 <Tommi.Komulainen@iki.fi>
	- Rewrote the /command handling to be more like rest of the irssi.
	  NOTE: this swaps the order of 'target' and 'key'
	- Don't make versioned library, added -avoid-version.
	- debian/rules: look for irssi sources in ../irssi-text-0.7.98.3/
	  by default.
	- debian/rules: don't build static library

Tue May  1 15:48:52 EEST 2001 <tss@iki.fi>
	- Fixed several memory leaks in both irc_crypt library and
	  irssi plugin
	- Removed misc.c and used GLIB functions instead, also replaced
	  strsep() with g_strsplit()
	- Several cleanups everywhere, also reindented code everywhere 
	  I touched :)
	- Removed IRC dependency - should work with all chat protocols now
	- Reverted the order of target and key in /KEY ADD
	- Ignore the nick which comes inside the crypted packet, it can be
	  used to fake the sender which isn't very good idea.

Fri Mar 15 23:17:14 EET 2002 <tss@iki.fi>

	- /idea command shouldn't crash when used in empty window
	- Fixed to use irssi 0.8's target_type parameter in send_message()
