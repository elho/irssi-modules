 Mobile module for Irssi.
 ------------------------

Installation:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --with-irssi=~/cvs/irssi

Irssi path defaults to ../

	make install
	(or)
	make user_install

Install irssiwap.php somewhere, you might also need to edit it. You _MUST_
give ending / after the URL or it won't work, ie. http://xx/irssiwap.php/,
because this is so hard to remember and looks ugly, you'll probably want to
create some directory for it and add "DirectoryIndex irssiwap.php" to
.htaccess. Then you could access it with http://xx/irssiwap/.

REMEMBER: THIS IS NOT SECURE!!! Someone with a sniffer can easily read all
your messages or write messages to channels. That's the reason I don't want
to allow sending arbitrary /commands to irssi at all through this module.

Start irssi, and start the module with

	/LOAD mobile

Module settings:

	/SET mobile_port (7070) - port to listen in for web server
	/SET mobile_webserver (127.0.0.1) - IP for web server
	/SET mobile_password () - Password for web server connection
	/SET mobile_msgappend ([via irssi-WAP]) - append this text
	     after each msg
